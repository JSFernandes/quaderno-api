# Introduction

Welcome to the Quaderno API! You can use our API to access all our features, designed around the idea of making tax management and invoicing easy for small businesses.

The Quaderno API is based on the [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) architectural style, and comprised of resources with predictable, human-readable and resource-oriented URLs. We make use of standard HTTP features (HTTP Authentication, Verbs, and Response Codes), understandable by any off-the-shelf HTTP client. We return [JSON](http://www.json.org/) for everything (including errors!), and expect to receive JSON for all `POST` and `PUT` requests.

We have language bindings for the Shell, [Ruby](https://github.com/quaderno/quaderno-ruby), and [PHP](https://github.com/quaderno/quaderno-php). You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top-right.

If you have any suggestions, tips, or questions that you feel aren't answered here or in our [Knowledge Base](http://support.quaderno.io), please [get in touch](mailto:hello@quaderno.io) and let us know!
